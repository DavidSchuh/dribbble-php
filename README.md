# PHP Wrapper for Dribbble API

## AUTHORS
Martin Bean (martin@mcbwebdesign.co.uk)

## ChangeLog
** 2/6/2011 (Zach Dunn)**  
- Tagged for v1.0  
- Player class now supports draftees and followers. See the new example page for use cases.  
- New proposed MIT license added to the repo.  
- Player class now returns specific player lists instead of entire player objects for `draftees()` and `following()`  
- The old `following()` method is now `shots_by_following()`, since it makes more sense semantically.  

## NEWS
-

## INSTALL
Simply deploy the files onto your web server's file system. Your server does require the `fopen` option though until an alternative method is used to fetch data from URLs.

## THANKS
Jeremy Weiskotten, who inspired me to write this. If Ruby on Rails is more your flavour, check out his Ruby gem, swish, which is a Ruby wrapper for the Dribbble API: http://github.com/jeremyw/swish
